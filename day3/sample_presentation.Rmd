## Add an image beloe

## Include an R Code 

- A vector can only contain objects of the same class

```{r }
a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # numeric vector
b <- c("one","two","three") # character vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) #logical vector
```


## Include an Image again

 - Using R Studio to create a Project  - From an existing directory

## Image again

## Mathematical Formula
$$
P(x>4) = 1-[P(x=0) + P(x=2) +P(x=2) +P(x=3) +P(x=4) ]
$$

$$X^2_{i,j}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( \frac{X_i}{Y_i} \right)$$


## Greek letters

$$\alpha, \beta,  \gamma, \Gamma$$

  
## Special Functions

$$\int_0^{2\pi} \sin x~dx$$
